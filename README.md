# Chatbot---Using-LSTM (UNI and BI directional) & GRU ( UNI and BI directional )
Learning different models of building the chatbot using LSTM and GRU with different hyperparameters

DATASET : cornel movie dialog corpus is our dataset and we have used 5000 dialogs as there are memory constraints with the COLAB PRO.

I suggest to use with COLAB PRO + for higher datasets to avoid any gpu memory issues.
